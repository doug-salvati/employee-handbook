# Employee Handbook

This was a project conducted for the [office of sustainability](https://www.uml.edu/sustainability/) at UMass Lowell.  The idea was to assemble the university's employment documents in a sustainable paperless format.  Unfortunately, it never got put into use.

Nevertheless, this was my first exploration with HTML, so I proudly present it here on GitHub.
